## Project Background
ABC is a leading logistics service provider with a comprehensive presence across all countries in Southeast Asia. Offering a wide range of logistics solutions—from transportation to warehousing—Ryo has established itself as a trusted partner for numerous e-commerce businesses.

ABC is committed to leveraging advanced data-driven approaches to tackle these problems.
- Late delivery risk: The company lacks clear insights into the root causes of frequent delivery delays, which negatively impact customer satisfaction and brand reputation.
- Delivery optimization: An analysis  of ABC's delivery process (improving route planning, selecting appropriate shipping methods etc)  to reduce delivery times and costs while increasing on-time delivery rates.
- Regional logistics performance: Comparing delivery timeliness and shipping costs across various regions to identify high-performing areas and regions requiring operational improvements.
